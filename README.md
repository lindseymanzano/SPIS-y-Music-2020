# SPIS-y-Music-2020

Have you ever wanted to see how your music taste compared to the music tastes of your friends, family, and peers? Well, with SPIS-y Music, you can do just that! This Machine Learning project analyzes the music tastes of SPIS members and matches them to the music tastes of other members using principal component analysis, k-means clustering, graphical data visualization, and Spotifyâ€™s Web API.
